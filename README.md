# Hi there 👋 I'm Laksha

Welcome to my GitHub! If you're here from my resume — great to have you.

I'm currently diving deep into software development and machine learning, while also working on end-to-end projects that bring real-world systems to life. Here are some of the things I’ve been building:

---

### 🔍 Featured Projects

- 🧠 [Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/Laksha10/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition)  
  A machine learning model that classifies handwritten digits using neural networks. Built using Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow.

- 🚉 [Railway Management System](https://github.com/Laksha10/Railway-Management-System)  
  A DBMS-based project developed using SQL and PL/SQL. Currently under development — will be expanded into a fully deployed, end-to-end system over the summer.
